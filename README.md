# Wordle Clone
This is a Python 3 CLI clone of Wordle. It takes a text file, picks a word, and presents the player with six chances to guess the word. If the player has not guessed the word after six chances, the game ends. If the player guesses the word, the player is presented with a new word. If the player guesses letters in the correct spot, the letter is printed in the correct place in the output. If they guess the wrong letter for the position, an "x" is printed.

## Usage
python3 wordle.py

## Wordle's everywhere. What makes this special?
I wrote this program using _only_ comments and GitHub CoPilot. I type in the comment, see what CoPilot comes up with, and if it seems to fit, I press tab. If not, I try to give a better comment and repeat. With the exception of the README, commented lines, and wordlist.txt, this is 100% CoPilot-generated code.
